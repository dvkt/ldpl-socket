![The LDPL Socket Library](images/ldpl-socket-logo.png)

The **LDPL Socket Library** allows you to open, close, write to, and read from network sockets in [**LDPL**](https://www.github.com/lartu/ldpl).

It's mostly made for clients - if you want to write a server, please see the library that this one is heavily based on: Lartu's https://www.github.com/lartu/ldpl-net-server

Requires **LDPL 4.3** or greater.

## üß∞ Installation

You can install this library **by hand** or **using [LPM](https://github.com/Lartu/ldpl#-libraries)**.

### üì¶ Installing using LPM

Open a terminal and write `lpm install ldpl_socket`. Once downloaded, include it in your LDPL project by adding the line:

```coffeescript
using package ldpl_socket
```

before the `data` and `procedure` sections of your source file. The library is ready to be used.

### ‚úãüèª Installing by hand

Include the library into your LDPL project by copying the folder *ldpl_socket* to your project directory and then adding the line:

```coffeescript
include "ldpl_socket/ldpl_socket.ldpl"
```

before the `data` and `procedure` sections of your source file. The library is
ready to be used.

## üìö Documentation

This library adds a few new statements to the language:

- `SOCKET CONNECT TO <hostname> AT <port> IN <number variable>`
   - Use this statement to open a new socket connection. Currently only TCP connections are supported. If the connection is successfully opened, your `<number var>` will be set to a "socket number" that's >= 0. Otherwise, `ERRORCODE` will be set to a negative number.
- `SOCKET CLOSE <socket number>`
   - Once a socket has been opened, use this statement to close it.
- `SOCKET SEND <text> TO <socket number>`
   - Use this to send messages to an open connection. `ERRORCODE` will be set to a negative number if the send call failed.
- `SOCKET SEND <text> TO <socket number> BYTES IN <number var>`
   - Same as `SOCKET SEND` but stores the number of bytes sent in `<number var>`.
- `SOCKET READ FROM <socket number> IN <text variable>`
   - This statement should be used to check for messages on a socket connection opened with `SOCKET CONNECT TO <ip> PORT <port>`. `<text variable>` will be set to anything received from the socket, which may not be an entire "message" in whatever protocol you're using. `ERRORCODE` will be set to 1 if the connection is closed. **Note:** By default this is a blocking call. Use the next statements to change that.
- `SOCKET READ FROM <socket number> IN <text variable> BYTES IN `<number var>`
   - Same as `SOCKET READ` but stores the number of bytes received in `<number var>`.   
- `SOCKET SET BLOCKING <socket number>`
- `SOCKET SET NONBLOCKING <socket number>`
   - By default all socket reads are blocking, but if you want to do a nonblocking call (or ensure you're using a blocking one) then these statements are for you. Basically they set/unset `O_NONBLOCK` on the underlying socket. In LDPL, `ERRORCODE` will be set to < 0 if there is an error or (most common in nonblocking mode) no data was available to be read. So, check for that.
   
## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Example

There's an example echo client in `examples/echo-client.ldpl`. Use it with Lartu's demo echo server by cloning that project and running the template:

    git clone https://github.com/lartu/ldpl-net-server
    cd ldpl-net-server
    ldpl net_template.ldpl
    ./net_template-bin

Then, back in ldpl-socket land, build and run the client:

    make echo
    ./echo-client 

You should now be in a little echo repl:

    ~ Connected to localhost:8888 (socket:3)
    < Hello there!
    > Well, I never!
    < Well, I never!
    > ...or have I?
    < ...or have I?
